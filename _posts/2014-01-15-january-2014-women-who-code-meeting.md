I attended my second [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Atlanta/events/158291842)
meetup last night.  This month's meetup was a 'Javascript Study Group.'  I've
been meaning to work on learning Javascript for a long time, but there is 
still so much to learn about Ruby and Rails.

The study group was very informal; we were given some resources and expected
to work on our own.  I decided to work on the free [Codeacademy Javascript
course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).  The course is really
easy.  I think I need to find a course meant for programmers who want to learn
Javascript instead of a course for programming beginners, but it's a good
starting point.  [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript)
has a Javascript course too.  I might work on that one next.  Of course I
also want to go through the HTML/CSS tracks on both sites as well.  I need
to devote some time to learning more about front end development.

For now, I plan to continue working through the Codeacademy course and start
the ["How to Learn Javascript Properly"](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/) 
study group on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/learn_js_in_seattle/comments/2tziaa/new_study_group_starting_january_2014/)
which happens to be starting this week. I have a few app ideas that require
Javascript knowledge, so I hope I learn a lot!

Quite a few more people attended this meetup compared to the December meeting,
and I met some lady developers who seem really cool and knowledgeable.  I hope
to see them again soon because it's really nice to talk to people from different
backgrounds.
