Hi!  I just finished my Ruby/Rails/backend internship at the Big Nerd Ranch 
on December 6, 2013. I was hoping to get a full time job while I was interning, but 
nothing worked out.  Since mid December isn't the best time to look for interviews,
I'm going to keep a record of what I worked on during this time. I've never kept a 
blog long term, but I'd like to try it!
