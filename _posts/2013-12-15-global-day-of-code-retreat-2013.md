Yesterday, I attended my first Code Retreat.  I wish I went to the last one in Atlanta, 
but I wasn't sure I was ready at the time.  I think my Ruby skills would have been fine 
based on what I heard about it later, so I was eagerly waiting for the next one.  I signed 
up right away when this Code Retreat was announced.

The code retreat was split into six sessions.  We worked in pairs implementing [Conway's Game 
of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) each time, but there were special instructions for most of the sessions.  Working 
with constraints was kind of tricky when I worked with someone who didn't know TDD or Ruby.

I never got far enough to work on the actual rules based on the neighboring cells in Conway's 
Game of Life, but I had a lot of fun working with different people. 

At the end, we were asked to answer a few questions.

**What did you learn today?**

I learned that everyone had different ideas about design and different approaches to the
problem.  I'm not sure what the best design is, but talking about design was really 
interesting. 
 
**What will you take away?**

I worked with a couple of people who tried to write the least about of code possible to make
a test pass, and I realized I knew how to write good tests, but I don't normally write great
tests on the first try.  I want to improve the quality of my tests in general, now that I've
noticed this.

**What would you do differently?**

I'd definitely like to learn to do TDD in another language and pair with people from other 
backgrounds.  My only experience with testing is with Ruby.
