I wanted to make a portfolio, but a Rails or Sinatra site seemed like overkill.  I decided
it was a good opportunity to try making a static website using Jekyll and Github Pages.

I did some research and chose [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) as a base
project.  First I disabled the blog-related pages and figured out how to display my own
pages in the navigation bar.  After adding some content, I decided that having a blog isn't
a bad idea. 

I'm still having a little trouble getting everything the way I want it, but it's really 
easy and satisfying to be able to deploy to GitHub so easily.
