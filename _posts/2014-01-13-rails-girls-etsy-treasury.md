Back when it was closer to Christmas, I was thinking about [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) stickers(!), 
and searched [Etsy](http://etsy.com) for other Ruby, gem, computer, and nerdy science related items.  After 
exploring the *tons* of results I got back, I wanted to save some of my finds, so I made a [Rails Girls
themed Etsy Treasury](http://etsy.me/1eAlJGh)

I have a feeling we're going to need some Ruby cookies at a [Rails Girls Atlanta](http://meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta) 
meetup soon.
