## Challenge Champion
### **[http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com](http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com)**
My project with [Kylie Stradley](https://github.com/kstradley) for the Atlanta Rails Girls
[Silly Hacks Only](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/events/141284772/) event.

The user logs in with Twitter and is assigned an inanimate 'champion' at account creation and can use it to challege
other champions to contests. For example, your taco may challege a couch to a contest, then
find out you won or lost a cat herding contest. Challenge your Twitter friends!
