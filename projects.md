## Challenge Champion  

### **[http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com](http://challengechampion.herokuapp.com)**
My project with [Kylie Stradley](https://github.com/kstradley) for the Atlanta Rails Girls
[Silly Hacks Only](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/events/141284772/) event.

The user logs in with Twitter and is assigned an inanimate 'champion' at account creation  
and can use it to challege other champions to contests. For example, your taco may challege  
a couch to a contest, then find out you won or lost a cat herding contest. Challenge your  
Twitter friends!

My project with [Kylie Stradley](https://github.com/kstradley) for the Atlanta
[2014 Space Apps Challenge](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/location/atlanta/) event.

We won the award for "Best Use of Data" at our location.

Our [mission](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/earth-images-space-station/)
was to take photos collected by the International Space Station iSERV camera  
and make them accessible to the public.  We used the latitude and longitude in each  
picture's filename to display the images on markers on a Google map.
