Hi, I'm Melissa!

I made my first website in high school - a simple art portfolio hosted on Geocites and coded in Notepad.  I taught 
myself all of the HTML I needed, and though I didn't need something very advanced at the time, I've always been 
interested in learning how to make more complex sites.

When I started college, I planned to major in Graphic Communications, but I quickly changed my mind and started 
taking computer science classes.  I was interested in many other topics as well, so I graduated from [Clemson University](http://clemson.edu) 
with a major in Computer Science and a minor in fine arts.

After graduating, I got a job at [Drake Software](http://drakesoftware.com) working on file conversion applications in C++.  This was interesting
for a while, and I was able to learn more about C++ and large data files, but after several years, I really wanted
start building new apps instead of maintaining ones that other people wrote. I had just started dabbling in Ruby on Rails,
when I heard there would be a [Rails Girls workshop](http://railsgirls.com) in Atlanta.  I was accepted to participate, and at the workshop, I
met many amazing and kind people involved in the [Ruby on Rails community in Atlanta](http://meetup.com/atlantaruby/).  I started learning Ruby more 
seriously after that, and in the summer of 2013, I left my job at Drake Software to becoming a Ruby on Rails intern at
the [Big Nerd Ranch](http://bignerdranch.com).  I found that consulting with so many brilliant developers was so much more interesting and 
and challenging than my previous job.  I loved being able to be paid to learn once again.  My internship ended in December
of 2013, so I'm working on some [personal apps]({{ site.url }}/projects.html) and leveling up my web development skills now. 

I also enjoy making and building things off the computer.  I do quite a bit of knitting, and I love the
process of knitting as much as the finished projects.  I'm always up for learning a new technique or figuring
out how to modify instructions to get what I want.  I love nature and gardening. I have a small vegetable and herb garden 
at my apartment as well as a succulent collection.  I also enjoy drawing, reading sci-fi and fantasy books, drinking 
coffee and tea, and petting cats - preferably as many of those as possible as the same time!  I try to work some
yoga into my day even though all of my other interests are a distraction.
